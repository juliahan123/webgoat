== Concept

Logging is essential for modern systems. We use it for various reasons:

- Application monitoring and debugging.
- Audit logging: record specific actions of your users and systems.
- Security event monitoring: provide information to a SIEM or SOAR system that will trigger based on the information provided in these logs.

== Goals

- The user should have a basic understanding of logging and what to log.
- The user understands the risks of log spoofing and leaking log information.
- The user will be able to make a simple log spoofing attack.
- The user will be able to tell the primary risks involved in logging.
